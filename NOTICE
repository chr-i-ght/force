** O Kali, Thou art fond of cremation grounds;
** so I have turned my heart into one
** That thou, a resident of cremation grounds,
** may dance there unceasingly.
** O Mother! I have no other fond desire in my heart;
** fire of a funeral pyre is burning there;
** O Mother! I have preserved the ashes of dead bodies all around
** that Thou may come.
** O Mother! Keeping Shiva, conqueror of Death, under Thy feet,
** Come, dancing to the tune of music;
** Prasada waits With his eyes closed
**
